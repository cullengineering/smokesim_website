# Cloudflare Pages Redirects Configuration
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/redirects/

# Note: Domain-level redirects (www to non-www, HTTP to HTTPS) 
# are handled by Cloudflare's DNS/domain settings, not _redirects

# Block problematic URLs from being indexed (but don't redirect to avoid loops)
/404 /index.html 200
/api/* /index.html 200

# SPA fallback - serve index.html for client-side routing  
# This should be the last rule to catch all unmatched routes
