        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Smoke control CFD simulation uses computational fluid dynamics to model fire dynamics, smoke movement, and ventilation performance in buildings. We use NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) to predict smoke behavior, visibility levels, and temperature distributions for fire safety design and building regulations compliance."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) is the world's leading fire modeling software for CFD simulation. FDS uses advanced computational fluid dynamics to model fire behavior, smoke production, heat transfer, and combustion processes. Our experts use FDS for professional smoke control design and fire safety engineering."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer", 
        "text": "CFD simulation provides accurate, quantified predictions of smoke behavior that simple calculations cannot achieve. CFD modeling allows optimization of smoke ventilation systems, validates design performance, and provides detailed visualizations for building control approval and regulatory compliance."

      "name": "What building regulations does CFD simulation support?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Our CFD simulation services support UK building regulations including Approved Document B, BS 9999, BS 9991, and BS 7346 standards. CFD modeling provides performance-based evidence for smoke control system design and helps demonstrate compliance with fire safety requirements."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How long does a smoke control CFD simulation take?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "CFD simulation timelines depend on project complexity. Simple smoke control CFD models typically take 1-2 weeks, while complex multi-scenario fire dynamics simulations may require 3-4 weeks. We provide detailed project timelines during the proposal stage."
